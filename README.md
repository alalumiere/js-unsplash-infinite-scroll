# Infinity Scroll Using Unsplash API

This project shows the popular infinity scroll feature using photos from Unsplash. Designed to be responsive for web and mobile.

**This is a Demo app for my portfolio. Unsplash only allows 50 requests per hour for Demo apps. If the images are not loading, there may have been too many requests within this hour.**
